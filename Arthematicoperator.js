// Arthimatic Operators


// Arthematic operator is a normal operator which we use in simple mathematic operations-
// Its is the same as mathematic operators.


// addition "+"  for add numbers
// subtarction "-" for subtract numbers 
// multiplication "*" for multiply numbers
// division "/" for divide nummbers
// modulus "%" its not for percentage but give reminder of two numbers
// increment Operator "++" (it is operator to increase value +1 to its operand, but if it is placed after operand its return value then incrase value , but if it's palced before operand its increase value first then return value)
// Decrement Operator "--" (it is operator to increase value -1 to its operand, but if it is placed after operand its return value then decrease value , but if it's palced before operand its decrease value first then return value)



let numm_1 = 200;
let numm_2 = 150;

console.log(numm_1 + numm_2) //output 350
console.log(numm_1 - numm_2) //output 50
console.log(numm_1 * numm_2) //output 30,000
console.log(numm_1 / numm_2) //output 1.33333
console.log(numm_1 % numm_2) //output 50
console.log(numm_1++) //output 200  rteurn value first the incrase 1 in value (same ass decrement)
console.log(numm_1) //output 201 return incremented value
console.log(--numm_2) // output 149 first decrease value -1 and return value (same as for increment)


// Arthmatic assigment Operators

// It's not the separate arthematic operator but it's arthimatic operator with assigment operator "=", It is use to perform arthimatic operation on variable and assign result back to theh variable


//Addition arthimatic  : +=, For Subtaraction : -= same as for other arthematic operator


// use case

numm_1 += numm_2 /// numm_1 = numm_1 + numm_2  its add both variable value adn reassign updated value to the numm_1

console.log(numm_1) //ouptput  = 350

//same as for other arthimatic operator
